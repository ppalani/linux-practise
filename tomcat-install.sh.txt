the first argument -x/--extract is always required as the first argument when extracting an archive...
"z" is used to "filter the archive through gzip".. is this only necessary for *.gz files?,Yes the "z" is only needed for tar.gz files.     
"j", you need the "j" argument, For tar.bz2 files
"v" is for verbose, to display a list of files/directories involved.. and is probably just personal preferance, right?
"f" is apparently the option to specify the archive file... but in the documentation for this command it says that the last argument in this command is always the filename.. am i misunderstanding this? does that mean you dont need to specify -f?
